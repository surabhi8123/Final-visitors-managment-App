# CSV Export Functionality Test

## Overview
The CSV export functionality has been implemented for the Visit History screen. When users click the "Export History" button, it will:

1. Create a CSV file with all visit records (or filtered records if filters are applied)
2. Automatically trigger a download in the browser
3. Show a success message to the user

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Django)
- Export endpoint: `/visitors/export/`
- Supports filtering by name, email, phone, and date ranges
- Returns CSV file with proper headers and content disposition
- CSV includes: Visitor Name, Email, Phone, Purpose, Host Name, Status, Check-in Time, Check-out Time, Duration

### Frontend (React Native Web)
- Modified `exportVisitHistory` function in `services/api.ts`
- Uses browser's Blob API and URL.createObjectURL for file download
- Automatically triggers download using a temporary anchor element
- Includes proper cleanup of blob URLs and DOM elements
- Passes current filters to export function for filtered exports

### Key Features
- ✅ Browser-compatible file download
- ✅ Respects current filters (name, email, date)
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code structure
- ✅ No interference with existing functionality
- ✅ Preserves all existing styles and components

## Testing Steps

1. Navigate to the Visit History screen
2. Apply some filters (optional)
3. Click the "Export History" button
4. Verify that a CSV file downloads automatically
5. Check that the CSV contains the expected data
6. Verify that filtered exports only include matching records

## File Changes Made

1. **`frontend/app/services/api.ts`**
   - Updated `exportVisitHistory` function for browser compatibility
   - Removed React Native FileSystem dependency
   - Added browser environment detection

2. **`frontend/app/history.tsx`**
   - Updated export function to pass current filters
   - Improved success message
   - Added filter validation logic

3. **`frontend/src/types/index.ts`**
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation issues
   - Removed unnecessary JSX code

4. **`frontend/src/utils/network.ts`**
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation issues
   - Removed unnecessary JSX code

## Browser Compatibility
The implementation works in all modern browsers that support:
- Blob API
- URL.createObjectURL
- File download via anchor elements

## Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and displayed to the user
- Browser compatibility is checked before attempting download
- Proper cleanup of resources to prevent memory leaks
