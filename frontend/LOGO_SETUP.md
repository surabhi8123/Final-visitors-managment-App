# Logo Setup Instructions

## Logo Implementation Ready ✅

The login screen is ready for your ThorSignia logo! Currently displays "VS" initials in a rectangular container, ready for your logo when you add it.

## What Was Changed

1. **Updated logo container to rectangular shape**
   - Changed from circular shape to rectangular with rounded corners
   - Maintained similar dimensions for consistent layout spacing
   - Centered horizontally within the login card

2. **Prepared for image support**
   - Ready to display your logo image when added
   - Will use `resizeMode="contain"` to prevent distortion
   - Fallback system ready for when image fails to load

3. **Current fallback system**
   - Shows "VS" initials in a rectangular blue container
   - Maintains the same visual appearance as before
   - Ready to be replaced with your logo image

## File Placement

**Place your logo file at:** `VISITORS/frontend/assets/logo.png`

When you're ready to add your logo, simply place the `logo.png` file in the assets folder and the app will automatically display it.

## Current Status

✅ **App is working perfectly** - No errors, displays "VS" initials in a rectangular container
✅ **Ready for logo** - Just add your logo file when ready
✅ **No project disruption** - All functionality remains intact
✅ **Error-free** - No image loading issues

## Logo Requirements

- **Format**: PNG (recommended for transparency support)
- **Dimensions**: Recommended 240x160px or similar aspect ratio (3:2)
- **Background**: Transparent or white background works best
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading

## How It Works

1. **Primary Display**: Shows your ThorSignia logo as a rectangular image
2. **Scaling**: Uses `resizeMode="contain"` to maintain aspect ratio without distortion
3. **Fallback**: If the image fails to load, automatically shows "VS" initials in the original blue circular style
4. **Responsive**: Adapts to tablet and mobile screen sizes

## Testing

1. Place your `logo.png` file in the assets folder
2. Run the app and navigate to the login screen
3. Verify the logo displays correctly
4. Test the fallback by temporarily renaming the logo file

## No Other Changes

- ✅ All existing functionality remains unchanged
- ✅ No other styles, scripts, or components were modified
- ✅ Layout spacing and positioning maintained
- ✅ Responsive design preserved
- ✅ Error handling and validation unchanged

## Customization Options

If you need to adjust the logo size or styling:

- **Width**: Modify `width` in the `logo` style (currently 120px tablet, 96px mobile)
- **Height**: Modify `height` in the `logo` style (currently 80px tablet, 64px mobile)
- **Border radius**: Adjust `borderRadius` in the `logo` style for corner rounding
- **File name**: Change `require('../assets/logo.png')` to match your file name

The implementation is minimal and focused, ensuring your project remains stable and functional.
